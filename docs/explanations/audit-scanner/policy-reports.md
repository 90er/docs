# Policy Reports

When using the Kubewarden Audit Scanner, the results of the policy scans are
stored using the
[PolicyReport](https://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/wg-policy-prototypes/blob/master/policy-report/docs/index.html)
Custom Resource.

:::caution
Note that the PolicyReport CRDs are under development in the `wg-policy`
Kubernetes group. Therefore, this documentation can be out of date if a new
version of the CRDs is released.

Check the `wg-policy` group
[repository](https://github.com/kubernetes-sigs/wg-policy-prototypes) for
more information about the CRDs.
:::

These CRDs provide a structured way to store and manage the audit results.

Each namespace scanned by the audit scanner will have a dedicated
`PolicyReport` resource defined inside of it.

The results of Cluster wide resources are going to be found inside of a
`ClusterPolicyReport` object. There is going to be only one
`ClusterPolicyReport` per cluster.

The audit results generated by the scanner includes various information, such
as the policy that was evaluated, the resource being scanned, the result of the
evaluation (pass, fail, or skip), and a timestamp indicating when the
evaluation took place. Additionally, you can optionally define severity and
category annotations for your policies.

You can also leverage the optional UI provided by the
[policy-reporter](https://github.com/kyverno/policy-reporter) open source
project for monitoring and observability of the PolicyReport CRDs.
Furthermore, operators can access the reports via ordinary `kubectl` commands.


Let's take a look at some example audit results generated by the audit scanner:

## Cluster-Wide Audit Results example

In the next example, the audit scanner has evaluated the
`cap-testing-cap-policy` on multiple namespaces in the cluster. The results
indicate that all the namespaces passed the policy validation. The `summary`
section provides a summary of the audit results, showing there were no
errors, failures, or warnings.

```yaml
apiVersion: wgpolicyk8s.io/v1beta1
kind: ClusterPolicyReport
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2023-07-10T19:25:40Z"
  generation: 1
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubewarden
  ...
results:
- policy: cap-testing-cap-policy
  ...
  resourceSelector: {}
  resources:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    name: kube-system
    ...
  result: pass
  rule: testing-cap-policy
  source: kubewarden
  timestamp:
    nanos: 0
    seconds: 1689017140
- policy: cap-testing-cap-policy
  ...
  resourceSelector: {}
  resources:
  - apiVersion: v1
    kind: Namespace
    name: default
    ...
  result: pass
  rule: testing-cap-policy
  source: kubewarden
  timestamp:
    nanos: 0
    seconds: 1689017140
...
summary:
  error: 0
  fail: 0
  pass: 6
  skip: 0
  warn: 0
```


## Namespace-Specific Audit Results example

In this example, the audit scanner has evaluated multiple policies on resources
within the `default` namespace. The results indicate that some of the resources
failed the validation for the `cap-no-privilege-escalation` policy, while
others passed the validation for the `cap-do-not-run-as-root` policy. The
`summary` section shows a summary of the audit results, indicating the number
of failures and passes.

```yaml
apiVersion: wgpolicyk8s.io/v1beta1
kind: PolicyReport
metadata:
  creationTimestamp: "2023-07-10T19:28:05Z"
  generation: 4
  labels:
    app.kubernetes.io/managed-by: kubewarden
  ...
results:
- message: one of the containers has privilege escalation enabled
  policy: cap-no-privilege-escalation
  ...
  resourceSelector: {}
  resources:
  - apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx-deployment
    namespace: default
    ...
  result: fail
  rule: no-privilege-escalation
  source: kubewarden
  timestamp:
    nanos: 0
    seconds: 1689017383
- policy: cap-do-not-run-as-root
  ...
  resourceSelector: {}
  resources:
  - apiVersion: apps/v1
    kind: Deployment
    name: nginx-deployment
    namespace: default
    ...
  result: pass
  rule: do-not-run-as-root
  source: kubewarden
  timestamp:
    nanos: 0
    seconds: 1689017383
...
summary:
  error: 0
  fail: 8
  pass: 10
  skip: 0
  warn: 0
```
