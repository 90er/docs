# Getting started

The `chimera-admission` project is the core component of the Chimera
project. It's an admission controller that is designed to
validate and, in the near future, to mutate incoming requests
made agaist the Kubernetes API server.

The next sections will guide you through its deployment.

We are still in our early days, the admission controller is not meant
to be used in production. Moreover, we plan to improve its UX in the near
future.

However everything is already functional and it can be used to play with
Kubernetes admission policies written in WebAssembly.
